What I like about html is that its pretty straight forward once you understand the syntax. I like that the browser renders the markup language versus using a compiler. This keeps is fast and lightweight. As I continue to learn, I will understand more tags I can use for my webpage. http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp seems to be my go to site for html and css. Loading the external stylesheer to my dbc1.html page was giving me issues because I forgot that I had the stylesheet folder nested inside another folder.
