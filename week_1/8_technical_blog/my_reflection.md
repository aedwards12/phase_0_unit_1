Blog url: http://aedwards12.github.io/unit1_projects/blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

One of my classes for college this semester has me writing a blog. Im not very good at it and because im not a good writer I dislike writing. However I do enjoy reading talented writers works of art. My blog gets only a few views. Probably only students from my class and I never recieve comments about what the viewer thinks of my content. Blogs do help you flush out your ideas on future or current projects.
