## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?


When I first set up git and Github a few months ago I had a hard time becuase. Mainly because I was just experimenting with it on terminal and did not completely understand what I was doing. Now that I have read the literature, I don't completely understand everything still but I have a deeper understanding of the content and what I am doing.

git  =  local archive of file creation and it changes. it keep track of who made changes, dates, what changes were made, and comments 

github = online hub, just like git, but allows you to collaborate with other people on projects.
         each collaborator can work on there own copy of master file, then merge files into a single master file
         
Version control let you keep track of changes you make to a file, it remembers the changes you make, if by chance you make a mistake in a current version you can rollback to an earlier version and start over. Github is important because you can work with collaborators remotely. With the use of merging we can all work off the same files. If we make a mistake git keeps track of older versions we can start over from. 

Developers use git because it has become the industry standard, also its very important to keep track of changes you've made to the file. Git allows team members to work on a clone of the master copy. If the team member makes a mistake, it only affect his working copy and not the rest of the group. That team member can then start over without effecting the rest of the group. It makes sense to me because its a safe and easy way to keep track of my workflow and a nice safety net incase of a mishap. 

This all makes sense to me, learning the syntax and system calls will be a challenge.
