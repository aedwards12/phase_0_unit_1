Open source means that you can share your project for other people to freely use as they wish, they can add to it, ot they can make it better. 

Open source can be a good or bad thing. I feel that you can have a good idea in an open source community then someone can take your idea and run with it, possibly making it better and making more money. But if you are not worried about that then its good. 

Licenses allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. 

This challenge gave me a better idea how to create a new repository and clone it to my local computer using the GitHup App. Im still unsure why I have to use ".github.io." in the naming convention. I have a better understanding what open source means.  Additionally to the provided links http://opensource.org/osd also helped.
