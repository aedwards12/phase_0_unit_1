A web server is a computer that can be access on the internet. my computer can be used as a web server as long as i have the proper software to set up the proper sockets and ports. 

first page or homepage of a site must be index.html, everything must have a opening and closing tab

I feel really accomplished when write code that actually works and does what I want it to do.  Its instant gratisfaction and it makes me want to code more. I have made a few sites on my own. At the moment none of these concepts were solidifiend but I know they are coming.
