Hello everyone!

Well I must say this week has been intense for me. Right now I am finishing my last days in college.  I have tons of assignments and projects due this week and next to go along with final exams the following week.  So trying to juggle all this has been a lot.  Im have a trouble trying to figure what all I am supposed to do to complete these challenges. I enjoyed learning about Git this week. Git/GitHub is something i've heard about but never actually knew what it was or how to use.  Some of the css is difficult to get a grasp on how to manipulate my divs the way I want.  This week I am going to try and find extra time accomplish these tasks earlier so that i do not have to scramble on the last day to finish. If you have any question please feel free to email me and I will be glad to hear from and hopefully help you.
