I had to ask my self how to move divs around. I had to question myself when to use id vs class's. Im still having trouble trying to constrain my body tag to the width of the browser. The sources I found useful were reading the text provided by this challenge. Im haveing trouble understanding the pseudo class labels. I did learn that the pseudo class was pretty cool to use and helpful to select a bunch of element at one time. Im fairly confident with using divs. Im confident in using css.  Positioning the divs pose a challenge at times. I enjoyed the pseudo clas selector. I didn't really find anything tedious.
