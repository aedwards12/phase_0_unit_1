#Reflection Guidelines

When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?   
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
* 

Code Game Reflection:
For this challenge I worked with fahia mohamed;  I found this challenge very tedious only because I have learned about object oriented programming before. Writing down the same functions over and over to complete the game was alittle too much but to a new programmer I can understand how it is necessary to learn from this site. The main issues i had was understanding what exactly I was supposed to do in order to complete these missions. I did like the last mission though, which was to use the canon and plot XY coordinates to defeat the enemey. For this challenge I did not learn any new tricks but for the next challenge I am sure i will. 

the '()' represents a method or function call the can be used by the object
the 'this.' represents the object being used at the time
the ';' semicolon is used as a delimiter during compile time to make the end of a statments or declaration

U1.W3: JavaScript Variables and Object Types:

For this challenge I worked by myself. Once I fully understood how this challenge worked I enjoyed it. I had a tough time installing node on my mac. Somewhere along the line I missed the directions on how to install it. I ended up googling tutorials on how to install node via terminal commands. This challege provided a good exercise on making various variable objects and arrays. It was nice to add object to that array in specified locations within the array. Im curious to learn the how this tutorial was made. I did not find this challenge tedious. This was much better than the second challenge. I did not learn too much on this challege but got more practice declaring various objects.  I am confident with the learning competencies of this challenge.

Solo Challenge reflection:
This challenge taught me the most thus far.  I had to do some extra research on objects vs object literals. I also had to do some research on the delete feature to delete a property, which is now nice to know going forward.  I still think I am unsure about object literals but I will practice more on it. I believe I understand most of it, but it will be more clearer the use of it as we move forward or in my own practice time.  I am fairly confident in my Learning Competencies of this challenge.  I enjoyed the test drive portion of this challenge. I thought repeating the add children.’name’ part was a little tedious maybe we could have done something else instead print out adam also.
