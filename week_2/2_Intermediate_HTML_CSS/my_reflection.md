# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think web standards are important. Its important to have a solid foundation for the viewer and for the designer. If you are working in a group its important that the next coder can understand what work has been done. I do like the addition of semantics by html5. I think it lays out the site much nicer and cleaner. Div id and classes can be alittle too much at times. I have used chrome, safari, internet explorer, and firefox i have noticed differences, i dont like that because it requires that you add alot more to your code to make the element look the way you want. There should be one standard. w3schol.com seems to be my go to site for alot of html markup.
