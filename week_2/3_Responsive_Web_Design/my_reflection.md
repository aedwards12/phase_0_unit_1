Responsive web design is critical in todoys economy. Everything now is designed with the user experience is mind. Users today want everthing to be presented in a nice clean format with alot of functionality. Responsive web design is: making sure your website can be equally functional in just about all visual platforms in the market. Technology is always changing and evolving, im sure by the end of this summer something new will have been implemented into the stardards of webdesign. I think smart phones have changed the way we think about the layout of the website. The positions of elements when i shrink the browser is confusing right now. Treehouse does a really nice tutorial using bootstrap framework.
