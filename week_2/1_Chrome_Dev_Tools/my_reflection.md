# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* 
Document Object Model is a platform or language that allows you to dynamically edit a webpage (html, css, javascript, js) in real time. The functionality makes sense of what i have done so far. How it works doesnt make that much sense. I love it becuase it allows me to test my webpage alot faster then saving the file and pressing the refresh button.
