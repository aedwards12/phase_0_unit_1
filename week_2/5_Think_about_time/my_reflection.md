# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* 
My biggest challenge during these first few weeks of Phase 0 are balancing my day with college, work, and completing these challenges. I go to bed extremely late and wake up early for class. By the time I finish my day of school, it's usually late and i have zero motivation to do anything. I just want to turn on the tv and watch basketball. There are sections of time when I could be free but instead I spend that time talking a socializing with friends. 

* How will you combat that? 
* 
College classes end for me next Monday, 14 May 2014. After that my schedule is completly open to focus on DevBootcamp. This week I can prioritize my day better and allot certain times of my day to commmit to DevBootcamp challenges. In the coming weeks i plan to have a schedule to make sure I give myself time to do challenges, photography, exercise, & fun activites. 

* What techniques will you try?
* 
I really liked reading about the pomodoro technique.  I think i will definitley trie this technique this week. My attention span is very brief and its something i would like to improve upon. I also plan on trying some meditation techniques. I want to start with just 2 minutes in the morning and build from there. I also plan on using the headspace mediation app. 


* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
* 
My overall plan for Phase 0 is to do the best I can do. I look forward to adding knowledge to what I already know and continue to build upon my education. I think I may even become a better writer by the end of this phase also, which is something I didnt expect to be doing as much of.
